                    My first topic is about <strong>Bash scripting</strong>. One of the first things I've learnt in the bootcamp.
                    I have never worked before with the command line, I have never really interacted with the
                    operating system üëÄ, that's what it is about: a Command-line interface (CLI). Of course, I use it 
                    to commit and push code to Github and so I just want to scratch on the surface, for now!
                    Here I introduce the most important shortcuts, how to access and move files and so on.

                <HighlightCommand value="pwd"/>      
                <p className={colorLightMode}>
                    Where am I located? This command shows the current working directory (print working directory)
                </p> 
                <HighlightCommand value="ls"/>
                <p className={colorLightMode}>
                    List the contents of the directory, files, pictures etc. In combination with <em>-a</em> you 
                    see all hidden files and with <em>-l</em> also the details of the files. You can chain it to <em>-la</em>.
                </p>
                <HighlightCommand value="cd"/>
                <p className={colorLightMode}>
                    Very important to know is the command to <em>change directory</em>.<br/>
                    <em>cd ~</em> is shorthand for going back to your home directory.<br/>
                    <em>cd ..</em> stands for: "Go up to the parent directory".<br/>
                    <em>cd (absolute path)</em>, than you go to your preferred directory<br/>
                    <em>cd ./anyfile</em> "Go from your current directory to a child file etc. (relative path)".<br/>
                    <em>cd ../..</em> With this you can jump through the levels of your directories.<br/>
                </p>
                <HighlightCommand value="clear"/>
                <p className={colorLightMode}>clear the terminal screen</p>
                <HighlightCommand value="man"/>
                <p className={colorLightMode}>If you want to know, what a command means, than get the <em>man(ual)</em>. Type man before the unknown command and you get an explanation.</p>
                <HighlightCommand value="touch"/>
                <p className={colorLightMode}>Okay, we start now to play around with files. With the command <em>touch</em> you create a new file and specify the name and type, like: touch hurra.js</p>
                <HighlightCommand value="cat"/>
                <p className={colorLightMode}> Read a file, the content will be printed to the terminal.</p>
                <HighlightCommand value="nano"/>
                <p className={colorLightMode}>
                    With the command <em>nano</em> and a file, a minimalistic text editor opens, which helps you to edit the file, if your up to.
                </p>
                <HighlightCommand value="mkdir"/>
                <p className={colorLightMode}>
                    With this command you create a new, empty directory. (<em>make directory</em>)
                </p>
                <HighlightCommand value="rmdir"/>
                <p className={colorLightMode}>Delete empty directories (<em>remove directory</em>)</p>
                <HighlightCommand value="rm"/>
                <p className={colorLightMode}>Delete a file or directory (<em>remove</em>)</p>
                <HighlightCommand value="mv"/>
                <p className={colorLightMode}><em>Move</em> a file to a different directory or rename a file: <strong>mv hurra.js /mnt/c/Users/whereever</strong> or <strong>mv hurra.js nohurra.js</strong></p>
                <HighlightCommand value="cp"/>
                <p className={colorLightMode}><em>Copy</em> a file: <strong>cp hurra.js hurry.js</strong></p>
                <HighlightCommand value="code"/>
                <p className={colorLightMode}>Open a file in Visual Studio Code</p>
                <HighlightCommand value="grep"/>
                <p className={colorLightMode}>
                    <em>g(lobal)r(egular)e(x)p(ression)</em>. With this you can do a global search for a specified file.
                    I will rise this topic in a next article again, when I recap JavaScript. With a pattern you can search for a file.
                    e.g.:*.[p]??, would return all files that have 3 letters as extension and start with a small p. 
                </p>
                <HighlightCommand value="history"/>
                <p className={colorLightMode}>Very helpful to see all past commands.</p>
                <HighlightCommand value="alias"/>
                <p className={colorLightMode}>
                    With this you can make your own abbrevations: <strong>alias alias_name="command to run"</strong>
                    <em>alias project="cd /mnt/c/Users/currentproject</em>. If you type now project into the terminal, you will be directed to the directory /mnt/c/Users/currentproject.
                </p>
                <HighlightCommand value="open Problem ???"/>
                <p className={colorLightMode}>
                    I have still an open problem, I didn't find the solution. All suggestions and solutions in the internet didn't help.
                    I would like to change the home directory, cd ~. I know I can change it in the bashrc file, but this will not really change the home directory.
                    I will make an update when I find the solution. 
                    I found also out that you can change it with <em>sudo usermod</em>, but with that the user must be logged out ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. 
                    My bootcamp-teacher knows it ...
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p className={colorLightMode}>Cursor/arrow up shows you your last typed commands. You can do so much more: Loops, conditions, declare variables ...! But later! Maybe! <strong>That's it for today with BASH!</strong></p>
